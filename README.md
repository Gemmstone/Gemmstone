Hewwo there! I'm Emma, also known as Gemmstone‚Äîa tech enthusiast who loves diving into the enchanting world of coding. As an Arch Linux and KDE lover, I find joy in exploring the realms of open-source technology while expressing my creativity through adorable projects.


## ‚ú® About Me

In this whimsical journey called life, I face the magical challenges of coding with my own uwu flair. I embrace my love for fashion, including dresses, skirts, makeup, and nails, as they add an extra sprinkle of cuteness to my coding adventures. However, I must admit that my path is not always smooth. As someone with ADHD, my coding journey is filled with bursts of hyperfocus and moments when my focus seems to wander off like a playful butterfly. But fear not, for within this chaos, I find moments of absolute coding magic.


## ‚ú® Projects ‚ú®

Join me in this whimsical adventure through my delightful projects:

### [üíº Sistema-de-Facturaci√≥n - PRIVATE](https://github.com/Gemmstone/Sistema-de-Facturacion)

A private project, developed all on my own for a small Guatemalan company. Over the course of almost 4 years, this project has grown and evolved to support the company's invoicing and inventory management needs. With approximately 71,300 lines of Python code and 63 .ui files, this project showcases its complexity and scale. Unfortunately, due to its private nature, I am unable to share the entire codebase. However, I'm more than happy to answer any questions you may have about its development process and the magical challenges I encountered along the way.

### [üß† LoFi-Fokus](https://github.com/Gemmstone/lofi-fokus)

Immerse yourself in a world of tranquility with LoFi-Fokus‚Äîan audio-only experience designed to enhance focus and concentration. Through soothing LoFi beats, this project creates a serene atmosphere that promotes productivity and peace of mind.

### [üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà PrideFlags-KDE](https://github.com/Gemmstone/prideflags-kde)

Express your pride and celebrate diversity with PrideFlags-KDE. This project offers SVG widgets that allow you to display a single pride flag or even a custom SVG on your KDE desktop. Personalize your digital space with a delightful array of preloaded pride flags or create your own unique SVG designs.

### [ü§ñ Kirlia Discord Bot](https://github.com/Gemmstone/Kirlia_2.0)

My experimental bot project, this one is the second version of it, where I continuously learn and explore new ideas. It serves as a versatile bot that can be customized and expanded to fit various purposes. While it may not currently fulfill a moderation role, it holds the potential to evolve and acquire new functionalities as I continue to develop and experiment.

May our adventures be filled with adorable coding moments, bursts of hyperfocus, and a never-ending supply of joy! Stay cute, stay creative, and keep tinkering with tech! ‚ú®
